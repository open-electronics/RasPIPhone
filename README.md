# RasPIPhone
This project aims to create a framework of daemons and apps to run a phone natively
on a Raspbian distro, where natively means leaving the distro desktop as background.
This would let the user to use all other Raspbian apps with their phone.
What is meant to distinguish this one is there is no use of Python, so the app is not
occupying the whole desktop.
